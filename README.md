A Go library for interacting with Common Alerting Protocol messages

The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is a simple but general format for exchanging all-hazard emergency alerts and public warnings over all kinds of networks.

The CAP specification can be found on the [OASIS website](http://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.html).
